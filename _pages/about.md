I am a Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in technology and innovation. Currently, I am working as a Digital Transformation Graduate, where I assist in leveraging cutting-edge digital solutions to drive organizational growth. My passion for technology, particularly in cybersecurity, has inspired me to pursue a career as a SOC Analyst. With my background in IT and an ever-growing enthusiasm for security, I am focused on developing my skills to contribute to safeguarding critical infrastructure and responding to cyber threats.

Why cyber security?
======
My interest in cybersecurity stems from its critical role in protecting the digital world and the ever-evolving nature of the field. As technology advances, so do the threats, making cybersecurity a dynamic and fast-growing industry that constantly presents new challenges. I‚Äôm particularly drawn to Security Operations Centers (SOCs) because they sit at the heart of threat detection and response. The idea of monitoring systems in real time, identifying potential intrusions, and taking swift action to defend against cyberattacks aligns perfectly with my passion for problem-solving and my desire to make a meaningful impact in the digital space.

This passion for cybersecurity was first sparked during my Computer Science degree, specifically in a module dedicated to the subject. Ever since, I‚Äôve been motivated to deepen my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest developments in the field. I demonstrated this commitment by earning the CompTIA Security+ certification and am currently immersing myself in the Let's Defend SOC Analyst Learning Path to gain practical, hands-on experience. As a hands-on learner, I enjoy exploring and breaking down complex concepts to build and sharpen my skills, ensuring I‚Äôm prepared to thrive in a real-world SOC environment.

What you will find here?

Here, you'll find a collection of work documenting my journey toward becoming a SOC Analyst. This includes hands-on labs, cybersecurity projects, and learning resources I've explored to build and strengthen my skill set. I use this space to share my progress, reflect on what I‚Äôve learned, and demonstrate my growing experience in threat detection, incident response, and Blue Team operations.
